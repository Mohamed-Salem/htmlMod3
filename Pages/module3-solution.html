		An obligatory and signficant part of the recruitment process for embedded
		systems programmers seems to be the 'C Test'. Over the years, I have had to
		both take and prepare such tests and in doing so have realized that these tests
		can be very informative for both the interviewer and interviewee. Furthermore,
		when given outside the pressure of an interview situation, they can also be quite
		entertaining (hence this article).
		From the interviewee's perspective, you can learn a lot about the person that
		has written or administered the test. Is the test designed to show o the writer's
		knowledge of the minutiae of the ANSI standard rather than to test practical
		know-how? Does it test ludicrous knowledge, such as the ASCII values of certain
		characters? Are the questions heavily slanted towards your knowledge of system
		calls and memory allocation strategies, indicating that the writer may spend his
		time programming computers instead of embedded systems? If any of these are
		true, then I know I would seriously doubt whether I want the job in question.
		From the interviewer's perspective, a test can reveal several things about the
		candidate. Primarily, one can determine the level of the candidate's knowledge
		of C. However, it is also very interesting to see how the person responds to
		questions to which they do not know the answers. Do they make intelligent
		choices, backed up with some good intuition, or do they just guess? Are they
		defensive when they are stumped, or do they exhibit a real curiosity about the
		problem, and see it as an opportunity to learn something? I nd this information
		as useful as their raw performance on the test.
		With these ideas in mind, I have attempted to construct a test that is heavily
		slanted towards the requirements of embedded systems. This is a lousy test to
		give to someone seeking a job writing compilers! The questions are almost all
		drawn from situations I have encountered over the years. Some of them are very
		tough; however, they should all be informative</br>
